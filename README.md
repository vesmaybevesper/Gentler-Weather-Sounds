_Gentler Weather Sounds is an update/ spiritual successor to [Alternative Rain Sounds](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/alternative-rain-sounds) by paoleks._

Gentler Weather Sounds aims to replace Minecraft's harsh, almost white noise-sounding rain with something that's more pleasant to listen to. It also replaces thunder sounds.

### FAQ

- **Can I use this in a modpack?**
  
    Yes, please save as many people as you can from the horrid Vanilla rain sounds


- **Would you support modded weather?**

    I'm open to it. It would have to have a default sound that I find annoying. At this time I'm not doing replacment for the sake of replacment. You can drop your requests on the github page.

- **What was wrong wtih Alternative Rain Sounds?**

    Nothing, unless you plan on playing on versions past 1.20.1, the vanilla rain sound would end up playing instead of the alternative ones. This update fixes that issue.
